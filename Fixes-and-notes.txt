Fixes todo:

- Fixing missing bracket on help softban, Required permissions section.
- Add missing permissions text to the error print out when translating everyones name.

Pricing Ideas:

- Under 250,000 characters translated per month = Free use
- 250,000 characters translated per month = $1 per month
- 500,000 characters translated per month = $12 per month
- 1,000,000 characters translated per month = $25 per month
- 2,000,000 characters translated per month = $50 per month
- 5,000,000 characters translated per month = $120 per month
- 10,000,000 characers translated per month = $230 per month

For every 1,000,000 more characters than 10,000,000 translated per month, 
it will only cost an extra $30 dollars on top of $230 per month.
Eg: 20,000,000 characters translated per month = $530 per month.

Cost calculation is equal to (3 x number of translations per month) / 100,000 - 70
